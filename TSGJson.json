We have exposed three Android platform specific properties (only writeable properties ) in browser widget, they are as below:<br>1)useWideViewport: Sets whether the browser should enable support for the \"viewport\" HTML meta tag or should use a wide viewport. If useWideViewport is true, it loads the browser with the attributes defined in the meta tag of the webpage. It scales the web page as defined in the html. Input Type : boolean Example: frm.browser.useWideViewport = true;<br>2)enableOverviewMode : Sets whether the browser loads pages in overview mode, i.e, zooms out the content to fit on screen width. Note: To use enableOverviewMode, useWideViewport property should be set to true and browser should be screenlevel widget, if it is non-screenlevel behavior is undefined. Input Type : boolean Example: frm.browser.enableOverviewMode = true zoomDensity :Sets the default zoom density of the page. Constants for specifying the browser's desired zoom density are: 0  FAR makes 100% looking like in 240dpiExample: frm.browser.zoomDensity = 0; Important Considerations: <br>1)enableOverviewMode and zoomDensity properties are supported from API level 7(i.e Android OS version 2.1 only). To use these properties minimum SDK value to be set for minSDK and targetSDK is 2.1 <br>2) When useWideViewport is true,when both enableOverviewMode and zoomDensity properties are set to browser widget,enableOverviewMode takes precedence over zoomDensity property.<br> 3)We need to set browser as screenLevel widget to use enableOverviewMode and zoomDensity properties otherwise it may result in undefined behavior. <br>4)Screenlevel browser widget should be directly placed inside a form for enableOverviewMode property to work. <br>5) As per Android documentation, zoomDensity property is supported only upto Android version 4.3. From Android 4.4 onwards android document specifies that the desired zoom effect can be achieved by adjusting 'width' and 'initial-scale' attributes of page's 'meta viewport' tag or use enableOverviewMode.
